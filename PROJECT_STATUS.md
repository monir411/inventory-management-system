# 1. Project Overview

This project is a dealer/distribution ERP-style admin workspace with:

- a NestJS REST backend
- a Next.js frontend admin UI
- PostgreSQL persistence through TypeORM

Based on the current implementation, the app currently supports:

- company master data management
- product master data management
- route and shop master data management
- stock movement entry and stock summary calculation
- sales creation with multiple sale items
- due sales tracking
- due payment collection against an existing sale
- sales summary views and filterable sales listings

## Current MVP Scope

The current MVP scope appears to be:

- maintain operational master data
- calculate stock from stock movements
- create sales and reduce stock
- track due balances on sales
- collect later due payments
- review sales summaries by route/company/date

Authentication, purchasing, returns, reports/export, and migration-based schema management are not clearly implemented as part of the current MVP.

# 7. Business Logic Implemented

Only logic clearly visible in service-layer code is listed here.

- stock is derived from stock movement records
- `SALE_OUT` stock movement reduces stock
- stock movement product must belong to the submitted company
- inactive companies cannot receive stock movements
- inactive products cannot receive stock movements
- adjustment quantity cannot be zero
- route names are unique
- company codes are unique
- product SKU is unique within a company
- shop name is unique within a route
- shops cannot be created or moved under inactive routes
- sales validate company, route, shop, and product existence
- sales reject inactive company, route, shop, or product
- shop must belong to the selected route for a sale
- sale validates available stock before creation
- sale due requires shop
- paid amount cannot exceed total amount
- sale totals and profits are calculated on the backend
- sale creation creates `SALE_OUT` stock movement rows
- initial paid amount is stored as a payment record
- later payment collection updates `paidAmount` and `dueAmount`
- overpayment is blocked

The following are not clearly enforced in code:

- customer-level credit limits
- stock reservation before sale confirmation
- audit logging
- role-based access control

# 9. API Integration Status

## Fully connected pages

- dashboard
- companies
- products
- all products
- stock
- routes
- shops
- sales list
- create sale
- sale details

## Partial implementations

- route deactivation: backend implemented, not surfaced as a dedicated frontend action
- shop deactivation: backend implemented, not surfaced as a dedicated frontend action
- company delete: backend implemented, not exposed in current frontend API helper/page
- product delete: backend implemented, not exposed in current frontend API helper/page

## Broken or unclear flows

- due sale details loading had recent error context in user-reported behavior; backend now contains a fallback path in `SalesService.findOne`, but production behavior is not independently verified from this document alone
- Bengali text in `create-sale-page.tsx` shows encoding artifacts in terminal output; rendering behavior in browser is not clearly verified from code inspection alone

# 10. Seed / Demo Data

No confirmed seed logic.

What is clearly implemented:

- `backend/src/database/init.ts`
  - sets `DB_SYNCHRONIZE=true`
  - sets `DB_DROP_SCHEMA=false`
  - initializes schema without demo data
- `backend/src/database/reset.ts`
  - sets `DB_SYNCHRONIZE=true`
  - sets `DB_DROP_SCHEMA=true`
  - recreates schema without demo data

So the current codebase initializes empty tables only.

# 11. Known Issues / Current Problems

Only code-visible or directly observed issues are listed here.

- frontend API helper files do not expose backend delete endpoints for companies/products
- frontend route and shop pages do not expose dedicated deactivate actions even though backend supports them
- sale details payment history depends on the `sale_payments` table existing; older local databases may require rerunning `npm run db:init`
- some text strings in `create-sale-page.tsx` appear with encoding issues in terminal inspection; browser rendering is not clearly verified here

# 12. Next Development Steps

Based on currently missing modules/features in the codebase, the next obvious steps are:

- returns module
- reports/export module
- dashboard improvements

Due collection is already implemented in the current codebase, so it is not listed as a missing next step.

# 13. Local Development Guide

## Backend

### Run

```powershell
cd backend
npm install
Copy-Item .env.example .env
npm run db:init
npm run start:dev
```

### Environment variables

From `backend/.env.example`:

```env
NODE_ENV=development
PORT=3001
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://username:password@ep-example.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech/dealer_erp?sslmode=require
JWT_SECRET=replace-with-a-long-random-secret
FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:3000
DB_SYNCHRONIZE=false
DB_DROP_SCHEMA=false
```

### Notes

- API prefix is `/api`
- CORS origin uses `FRONTEND_URL`
- validation pipe uses `whitelist`, `transform`, and `forbidNonWhitelisted`
- `JWT_SECRET` exists in env example, but authentication is not clearly implemented

## Frontend

### Run

```powershell
cd frontend
npm install
Copy-Item .env.local.example .env.local
npm run dev
```

### Environment variables

From `frontend/.env.local.example`:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:3001/api
```
